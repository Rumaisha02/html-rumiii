  <p> <img src="./Screenshot (561).png"  width="200px" height="300px"/><br/> Bollywood romcom which is eternally beautiful.<br />Something that can never make me bore and gives that 
    same bliss everytime I watch it. <br />One of the main things are the songs of this movie. 
    The best...never getting old</p>  
<h3> 3:<a href="https://9animetv.to/watch/i-want-to-eat-your-pancreas-70?ep=58336">I want to eat your pancreas </a></h3>   
<p> <img src="./download (7).jpeg"  width="300px" height="200px"/> <br/>Once again an anime that makes my cry so hard.<br />So beautifully they presented japan and the story.
     Don't know how i managed myself after <br />that shocking ending but i for sure cried for days remembering it.</p> 

     <h3> 4:<a href="https://9animetv.to/watch/a-silent-voice-11?ep=50465"> A silent Voice </a></h3>
     <p><img src="./Screenshot (562).png" height="150px" height="150px" /> <br />
          One of the deep and different story i've watched till now. <br />Not like a normal 
     school bully but same with a different persepective.<br /> Feelings of purity of 
     a deaf person and how their family cope with everything <br /> happening around. 
     Made me sobb but was worh watching.<br /> 
    </p>

<h3> 5:<a href="https://9animetv.to/watch/suzumes-doorlocking-18190?ep=100501 " >SUZUME</a></h3>
<p> <img src="./Screenshot (545).png" width="300px" height="200px"  /><br />
 A japenese fiction by famous writer who made famouse movies like your name, withering with you etc.<br /> 
 This movie is a whole eye catching , a slight sense of affection with a lot fictious<br /> story background
is a must watch, it's animation and represtation fo japan is a must worthy thing.</p>
